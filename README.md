Dungeon Quest version 2.36 is a choose your own adventure game. 
The choices you make will decide whether you live or die. 
My game uses a multitude of while and if statements to create the choices in the game.
Each descision in the game is like an obsticle. 
Picking the wrong choice will enventually or imediately lead to your death, and picking the right choices will help you go over the obsticals that will lead to you your victory. 
The game might be fairly simple but it is also efficiecent.
People who helped me: Blaise Wilson, Andrew Yip, Jeff Tan.
